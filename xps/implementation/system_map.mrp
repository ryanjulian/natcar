   signal "proc_sys_reset_0/proc_sys_reset_0/EXT_LPF/exr_lpf_3" which will be
   trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why the input
   signal will become undriven.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
1276 block(s) removed
 174 block(s) optimized away
1329 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
